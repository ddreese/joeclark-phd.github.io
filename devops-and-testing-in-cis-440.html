</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The summer cohort of CIS440 is rolling along with five teams building web apps from scratch for businesses in the area, including a couple of brand new startups.  It's exciting to do this all in the short span of six weeks, and it's been a very high-energy group.  I suspect the fact that the teams are meeting daily instead of twice per week is helping with keep the momentum up.</p>
<p>This week the focus of my lectures has been on DevOps and on Testing, two concepts that I think are essential to software development but have never been included before in this course (which was originally more of a Project Management course).  In talking to professionals throughout the Valley, it has frequently come up that new graduates may have a lot of knowledge in <em>programming</em>, but never have any training in software testing or even basic tools for collaboration such as version control.</p>
<p>So, how should it be included in a course like this one?  This semester, I gave a basic lecture on a number of common DevOps approaches, without getting into specific tools, basing the lecture mainly on Paul Swartout's <i><a href="http://amzn.to/UvTAJV">Continuous Delivery and DevOps: A Quickstart Guide</a></i>.  Testing is an area I know even less about, so I ended up showing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukm64IUANwE">a video by Carl Meyer</a> and recommending <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILkT_HV9DVU">another one by James Bach</a>.  In addition, one assignment each student must do is participate in a "tech talk" for the class.  One group is presenting on a Git/Github workflow tomorrow, and another will present on some type of automated test runner next week.  (The "tech talk" idea has been a stroke of genius, by the way.  It allows the students to specialize and go beyond the core content of the course, while guaranteeing that I learn something new from each class.)</p>
<p>But I think that in the future I might be able to impart a lot more by doing something like creating a "DevOps" workflow for the whole class: have students turn in assignments via Git, grade team members somehow based on the repo's statistics (# of commits, or whatever), require testing from the beginning, maybe even define tests of my own which students will have to make their projects pass in order to get credit.  Hey... maybe I can get a student team next semester to work on this for me!</p>
