</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Once again I'm looking for capstone projects for senior students in the CIS undergraduate program at ASU. Students will be working in teams of 4-6 over a 15 week period and will be expected to use all of the knowledge they've gained throughout their undergraduate studies as well as learn new tools to fit the job. Past projects have included from-scratch web applications, mobile web sites and basic mobile apps, new features for existing web apps, data analysis, requirements analyses, and digital marketing projects involving SEO, social media, etc.</p>
<p>Past clients have included brand-new startups (even a lone founder with nothing more than paper sketches of his intended web app), small, medium, and large companies. Clients are expected to maintain communication with the students, who will present several working "demos" of the project as it emerges, and will need your feedback. Beyond that, there is no cost to participate, although I will expect you to fill out a questionnaire at the end of the semester to help me grade the students. Â This is a great opportunity for you to get a real project completed, to get to know some students who may be potential hires, and to give back to the ASU community.</p>
<p>In my opinion the most successful projects have been "from scratch" web development projects, because the students have training in web development already, and with new projects they won't face a big up-front hurdle of trying to understand someone's existing code. However, with the big group coming into the class this fall, it's usually possible to find enough students to take on other types of challenges such as mobile app programming or big data analytics.</p>
<p>If you are interested in sponsoring a project for the semester that spans August 21 to December 5, please <a href="mailto:joseph.w.clark@asu.edu">e-mail me</a> or call 480-965-0024 during the business day, and I'll tell you all about it.</p>
