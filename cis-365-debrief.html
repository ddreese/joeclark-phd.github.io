</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Teaching a short six-week session of CIS 365 with a small group (9 students) was a great opportunity to try out some new things in the curriculum including (as mentioned) the use of an open-source DBMS, PostgreSQL, for teaching.  Here's some of what I discovered from the experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BYOD with an open source DBMS works.</strong>  Postgres works just about the same on Macs and PCs, so there were no complications in letting the students use their own machines, but one:  I couldn't figure out how to set a PATH in the Mac OS, so it was challenging for Mac users to use the command-line features of <code>psql</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Adding a final "tech talk" assignment was a great way to focus the schedule on the DBMS.</strong>  Previously I'd held a day on using Access and Excel as database front-ends, a day on Tableau, a day on database-driven websites with PHP, and maybe some other special topics.  This cluttered the schedule and distracted the students.  For the summer semester, instead, I spent more time on advanced features like stored procedures, triggers, and fuzzy-text queries, and I assigned each team to prepare a tech talk for the class on one of those other technologies which might be used for the front-end of a database application.</li>
<li><strong>Group projects are still hard to grade fairly.</strong>  From the professor's point of view, it's hard to tell who's doing the work and why.  Next time, I'll keep the projects but probably make them a smaller part of the overall grading.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the coming year instead of CIS 365 I'll be teaching CIS 355, a course on data warehousing in our new Business Data Analytics major.  It should be a good course for me to leverage what I've learned about teaching SQL and RDBMSs, and explore a new application of those technologies.</p>
